With more than 20 number one hits, numerous awards and about 100 mln albums sold she is a real life example of a self-made woman who managed to overcome all the difficulties that encountered on her way (including a domestic violence scandal) and rise to the very top of her profession. Her every release is a hit, her every concert is a sell-out.</p> <p>Having secured her place at the Russian music hall of fame, ambitious Valeriya challenged herself with a new task and in 2008 she set her sights on the UK. The first success came after she had presented her version of the BeeGee's famous hit "Stayin' Alive" to one of its legendary authors Robin Gibb and they ended up recording it as a duet. Shortly after that Valeriya released in the UK her new single ‘The Party’s Over’ that raised up to the 2nd line of Billboard club charts. Following this success the singer was invited by Simply Red to perform as a support act during their "Greatest Hits" UK tour that included 2 sold-out shows at the huge O2 Arena in London.</p> <p>Valeriya has given shows all over the world. She performed in the USA, in the UK, had multiple tours across Europe (including a concert at the famous Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin) and was even invited to perform in several African countries. One of Valeriya's recent major shows was accompanied by the Russian National Orchestra (the first Russian orchestra to ever win a Grammy award).</p> <p>Even though Valeriya is mostly famous for her pop songs, she is one of a few singers who also perform romances - the real gem of the Russian music culture that better than any other genre captures the very spirit of the "mysterious Russian soul".</p> <p>At the Royal Albert Hall Valeriya will present her concert program "Valeriya and Friends" that will feature the singer's best hits over the past two decades as well as collaborations with other popular Russian and Ukrainian artists. Among those to come and support Valeriya at the Royal Albert Hall are: Valery Meladze, Iosif Kobzon, Victor Drobysh, Stas Pjeha, Vasiliy Gerello, Oleg Skripka (Vopli Vidopliassova), Alexander Kogan, Ruslan Alehno. A special welcome at the event will be given to Valeriya's son Arseny Shulgin - a young talented pianist, the winner of several international music contests and festivals. The concert "Valeriya and Friends" will be accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra conducted by Paul Bateman.</p> <p>This event is a unique opportunity to see the best of the Russian popular music in one night and it is not to be missed.</p> </div> <div class='_music-videos thumbnails'> <ul class=thumbnails-list> <li class="thumbnail _romances __primary_callout_secondary" data-40-bottom="transform: scale(0, 1);" data--30-bottom="transform: scale(1, 1);"><img class=thumbnail-image src="__assets/images/thumbnails/Romances-b2aba1f0.png"/> <div class=thumbnail-content> <div class='_callout thumbnail-content-group'></div> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext=1>Valeriya</p> <div class='_primary thumbnail-content-group'></div> <div class='_secondary thumbnail-content-group'></div> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='1.6'>Russian Romances</p> </div> <a class=thumbnail-link href="//youtu.be/Y1YAPUQNGX8">Watch</a> </li> <li class="thumbnail _serpantin __primary_callout_secondary" data-40-bottom="transform: scale(0, 1);" data--30-bottom="transform: scale(1, 1);"><img class=thumbnail-image src="__assets/images/thumbnails/Po_Serpantinu-5a1cbd97.png"/> <div class=thumbnail-content> <div class='_callout thumbnail-content-group'></div> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext=1>Valeriya</p> <div class='_primary thumbnail-content-group'></div> <div class='_secondary thumbnail-content-group'></div> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='1.6'>Po Serpantinu</p> </div> <a class=thumbnail-link href="//youtu.be/2K9N4VOOPFs">Watch</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </section> <section class=section id=guests> <div class=section-inner> <div class=copy> <h2 class=section-title>Guests</h2> </div> <div class='_guests thumbnails'> <ul class=thumbnails-list> <li class="thumbnail _shulgin __simple" data-40-bottom="transform: scale(0, 1);" data--30-bottom="transform: scale(1, 1);"><img class=thumbnail-image src="__assets/images/thumbnails/Shulgin-15ee96dd.png"/> <div class=thumbnail-content> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='0.9'>Arseniy</p> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='0.9'>Shulgin</p> </div> <div class=thumbnail-hidden style='display: none;'> <div class=thumbnail-lightbox id=thumbnail-shulgin-lightbox> <div class=copy> <h1 id=arseniy--shulgin>Arseniy Shulgin</h1> <p>Born on November 8, 1998 in Moscow in a family of musicians.

Kobzon was born to Jewish parents in the mining town of Chasiv Yar, in the Donbass region of Ukraine.</p> <p>As a boy he demonstrated a talent for singing, winning numerous regional singing contests. He reached the national finals on two separate occasions, appearing in concerts dedicated to Joseph Stalin - a significant honour at the time.</p> <p>Despite his talent for singing, Kobzon went on to technical school to study geology and mining in Dnipropetrovsk, as this was considered a lucrative vocation in the Soviet Union following the Second World War. However, in 1959, following his 1956-1959 contact with professional music instructors in the Soviet Army where he was a member of the armies song and dance ensemble, he decided that music would be his preferred vocation. In 1958, Kobzon officially started his singing career in Moscow, and enrolled to study at the Gnessin Institute.[2] In the next few years he made valuable contacts in Moscow's entertainment world, and was eventually given a chance by composer Arkady Ostrovski to perform some of his music.</p> <p>Initially, he performed in a duet with the tenor Viktor Kokhno, but was eventually offered a solo repertoire by many of the outstanding composers of the time such as Mark Fradkin, Alexander Dolukhanian and Yan Frenkel.</p> <p>In 1962, he recorded his first LP which included songs written by Aleksandra Pakhmutova.</p> <p>In 1964, he triumphed at the International Song Contest in Sopot, Poland, and in the following year he took part in the "Friendship" contest held across six nations, winning first prize in Warsaw, Berlin and Budapest.</p> <p>His popularity rose quickly, and demand for his singing saw him frequently performing two to three concerts a day.</p> <p>His most popular hit song at the time was titled "A u nas vo dvore".</p> <p>During Leonid Brezhnev's time in office , there was hardly an official concert where Kobzon did not take part, and in 1980 he was awarded the honour of People's Artist of the USSR.</p> <p>In 1983, Kobzon was expelled from the Communist Party and reprimanded for "political short sightedness," after he performed Jewish songs during an international friendship concert, which resulted in the Arab delegations leaving in protest.</p> <p>However, the following year, his reputation was restored, as he was honored with the USSR State Prize.</p> <p>His best-known song is "Instants" from the legendary Soviet TV series "Seventeen Instants of Spring".</p> <p>Joseph Kobzon appeared with solo concerts in most cities of the former USSR. He was also bestowed the rare honour of performing international concerts tours as a representative of USSR in United States, Panama, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Argentina, Israel, Republic of the Congo, Zaire, Angola, Nigeria, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Greece, and Finland.</p> <p>Throughout his career, he has shared the stage with many Western superstars, including the likes of Liza Minnelli and Julio Iglesias.</p> <p>In 1986, he was the first celebrity to visit and perform in the town of Chernobyl to cheer the nuclear reactor rescuers. Since then, Kobzon has performed on many occasions in disaster areas, and military hot-spots such as Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war, and Chechnya.</p> <p>Although, Joseph Kobzon officially ended his international touring career in 1997, he continues to appear in regular concerts before audiences around the world, and is frequently seen on Russian television to date. Kobzon is an honorary citizen of 28 cities: Anapa, Saratov, Donetsk , Bishkek, Dnepropetrovsk, Kramatorsk, Noginsk, Poltava, Slavic, Chasiv Yar, Cherkessk, Artemovsk, Horlivka and others. He is also an honorary citizen of the Saratov Oblast, Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrug and the Transbaikal Oblast.</p> <p>On 31 March 2009, Kobzon was awarded the title of Honorary Citizen of Moscow - "for his services and contribution to the organization and development of national culture, long-term activities designed to meet the challenges of the patriotic and cultural education of the Russian people, as well as charitable activity in the city of Moscow and other Russian regions". Considering Kobzon's career, personality, spirit and singing style, many say that he is Russia's answer to the U.S. crooner Frank Sinatra. The parallels between the two legends of the entertainment world are so uncanny, that Kobzon has been branded the nickname of 'Russia's Frank Sinatra'.</p> <p><a href="//iosifkobzon.ru/">http://iosifkobzon.ru/</a></p> </div> </div> </div> <a class="thumbnail-link lightbox" rel=relguests href="#thumbnail-kobzon-lightbox">Watch</a> </li> <li class="thumbnail _pyekha __simple" data-40-bottom="transform: scale(0, 1);" data--30-bottom="transform: scale(1, 1);"><img class=thumbnail-image src="__assets/images/thumbnails/Pjeha-5ee28d6f.png"/> <div class=thumbnail-content> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='0.9'>Stas</p> <p class='thumbnail-content-element fittext' data-fittext='0.9'>Piekha</p> </div> <div class=thumbnail-hidden style='display: none;'> <div class=thumbnail-lightbox id=thumbnail-pyekha-lightbox> <div class=copy> <h1 id=stas-piekha>Stas Piekha</h1> <p>A Russian popular singer and actor, and the grandson of Edita Piekha. He was born on August 13, 1980, the grandson of Edita Piekha and the son of Ilona Bronevitskaya, who were both famous USSR popular singers. His father, Peter Gerulis, was a jazz musician. As a young boy, Piekha spent time on tour with his grandmother while his mother pursued her solo career. At the age of 7, at his grandmother's insistence, his last name was formally changed from Gerulis to Piekha and he was enrolled in the Glinka conservatory in Leningrad to study the piano and choral singing. Subsequently, he was enrolled in the Gnessin conservatory, but he did not complete his degree. In 2004, Piekha became a contestant on the third season of the Russian hit television show Star Factory , a singing competition analogous to American Idol. He recorded his first popular hit during the show, a song called "One star" . During his audition for the show, Piekha said that his dream duet partner would be the Russian pop star Valeriya. He got his wish during one of the episodes and recorded the duet "You are sad" together with Valeriya. He also sang "July Morning" in a duet with Ken Hensley. At the conclusion of the season, Piekha became one of the three finalists and won a recording contract which led to the release of his debut album titled "One star", named after his first hit. He followed it up with a sophomore effort in 2008, releasing the album "Otherwise".

In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy. A further crisis arose when it seemed the orchestra's right to call itself "Royal" would be withdrawn.</p> <p>Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Doráti, André Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy; as of 2013 the incumbent is Charles Dutoit. Others closely associated with the orchestra have included Sir Charles Groves, Sir Charles Mackerras, Peter Maxwell Davies, Yehudi Menuhin and Leopold Stokowski.</p> <p>In 2004 the orchestra acquired its first permanent London base, at the new Cadogan Hall in Chelsea. The RPO also gives concerts at the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and venues around the UK and other countries. From its earliest days the orchestra has been active in the recording studios, making film soundtracks and numerous gramophone recordings; many of the LP recordings conducted by Beecham and others have been reissued on compact disc.</p> <p>The orchestra gives an annual series of concerts at the Festival Hall, and since 2004 has had a permanent home at Cadogan Hall, a former church in Chelsea, converted into a 900-seat concert hall and rehearsal space. At the Royal Albert Hall in London the RPO gives performances ranging from large-scale choral and orchestral works to evenings of popular classics.</p> <p>The orchestra maintains a regional touring programme, taking in venues throughout the UK, and has established residencies in Aylesbury, Crawley, Croydon, Dartford, High Wycombe, Ipswich, Lowestoft, Northampton and Reading. The RPO regularly tours overseas; since 2010 it has played in Azerbaijan, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain and the US. In 2010–11 and two subsequent seasons the RPO was the resident orchestra for a series of concerts in Montreux, Switzerland. In 2010 the orchestra toured England, with a repertoire preponderantly of Beethoven, including the Violin Concerto in which Pinchas Zuckerman was both soloist and conductor. In the same year, another tour featured Maxim Shostakovich conducting the music of his father, Dmitri Shostakovich. The RPO continues to feature at the Proms; in the 2010–12 Proms seasons the orchestra played works by Bach, Copland, Delius, Saint-Saëns, Tchaikovsky, Bax, Barber, Bartók and Prokofiev.</p> <p>The orchestra's community and education activities have continued into the 21st century. In May 2013 six youth ensembles from London boroughs and a 3,500-strong choir of children from local primary schools were given the chance to perform alongside members of the RPO at the Albert Hall. They played a piece composed by participants from all six musical ensembles.</p> <p>As well as performing works from the classical repertoire, the RPO has recorded a number of film scores, including those for Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann. Other scores recorded by the RPO are Olivier's Richard III, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.</p> <p>In 1987 the RPO established a sister ensemble, the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, which plays lighter classics. It succeeded a similar group, the Royal Philharmonic Pops Orchestra.</p> <p>RPO players have been involved with many performances away from the classical repertory; in the 1960s they pioneered the "mixed media" concert, appearing with The Nice rock band.Later non-classical ventures included Yanni Live at the Acropolis, a concert held in Greece in 1993, conducted by Shahrdad Rohani; In 1992 UEFA commissioned the orchestra and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields chorus to record the UEFA Champions League Hymn</p> <ul> <li><a href="//www.rpo.co.uk/">http://www.rpo.co.uk/</a></li> <li><a
